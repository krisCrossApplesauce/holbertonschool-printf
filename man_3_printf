.SH NAME
.B _printf
- A simple re-creation of the printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]…
_print(const char *format, [argument]…)
To use this function the #include "main.h" header is needed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Prints the string, FORMAT, with the ARGUMENT(s) – if any – according to the
specifiers in FORMAT. FORMAT works like any other string, with the exception
of specifiers and the output is written to stdout.
The specifiers are:
.RS 3
%c: a character
.RS 0
%s: string
.RS 0
%d: an integer of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%i: an integer of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%%: a single ‘%’
.RS 0

.SH CODING EXAMPLE
.PP
include "main.h"
int main(void)
{
int i = 1;
_printf("The value of i is %d.\n", i);
return (0);
}
B. Writes this output to stdout:
I. The value of i is 1.

.SH RETURN VALUES
The _printf() function returns an integer representing the number of symbols
printed, not counting the null byte (\\0) that ends the string.

.SH BUGS
Bugs are present in some outputs, but the cause is currently unknown.
